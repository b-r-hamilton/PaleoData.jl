1. Excel Workbook file with input metadata, source URLs, footnotes,
Data matrix:

     directory/file: input_data/Ocean2kLR2015sst.xlsx

2. Comma-separated-value (.csv) format file with input Data matrix,
corresponding to the final sheet of file (1):

     directory/file: input_data/Ocean2kLR2015sst.csv

3. Matlab script to produce composites shown in Supplementary Figure
1a and Fig 2a and of McGregor et al (2015):

     file: mkcomposite4s.m

     For further information, please see the code comments in
     mkcomposite4s.m.

     Running mkcomposite4s generates the files described in (4) below,
     in the directory: composites_generated/.

     These may be compared to the results that are in directory:
     composites_shipped/.

4. Output of mkcomposite4s.m: each with dimensions 10 rows x 57 sites,
rows corresponding to:

row1/bin1: 2000...1801,
row2/bin2:% 1800...1601,
row3/bin3:% 1600...1401,
row4/bin4:% 1400...1201,
row5/bin5:% 1200...1001,
row6/bin6:% 1000...801,
row7/bin7:% 800...601,
row8/bin8:% 600...401,
row9/bin9:% 400...201,
row10/bin10:% 200...1

4.1. Average ages for composite values:

     directory/file: composites_generated/stimem.csv 

4.2. Standardized composite SSTs:

     directory/file: composites_generated/binnm_nm.csv

4.3. Number of values composited to form the single values within
each bin and time:

     directory/file: composites_generated/binnNm.csv

5. Matlab workspace containing variables generated by mkcomposite4s.m:

     directory/file: composites_generated/compositework.mat

6. Figures (pdf format):

6.1. Supplementary Figure 1a, Figure 2a from McGregor et al (2015);

     directory/file: composites_generated/Ocean2kLR2015_SF1a_F2a.pdf

Running the code:
=================

Start matlab or octave from the folder containing the unzipped files.

Call mkcomposite4s within matlab or octave to ingest file listed under
item (2), and regenerate files listed under items (4)-(6) above.
